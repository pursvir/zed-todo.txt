Currently available Zed tasks are:
- "Mark as done" - mark a task under your cursor as done
- "Archive current file"
- "List contexts"
- "List projects"
- "Generate report"

To make them work make sure that you have [todo.sh](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli) installed and that it supports [environment variables overriding](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/pull/460).
